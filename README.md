TODO(
    Refine image-text content display on index.html
        I feel like the main content display is okay so long as we upload the images in a standard resolution. I think we can call it done for now with this and move on to other things.

    **Fix footer to work better on mobile devices. It currently spans all the way to the right on smaller devices.

    **Desktop loads slowly for me, I think the images need to be compressed, IDK if it can be done with HTML/CSS or if we need to manually compress them before upload.
